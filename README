The core of this project will be a roughly 5ish minute audiovisual composition that is generated procedurally from a user decided seed number. That way if the person wants to revisit or share what they experienced, they can keep track of the seed number they used and re-enter it. The emphasis will be on quality over quantity. We will start small with music and visuals that are high quality and then work on expanding with more elaborate variations from there.
